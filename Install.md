22. You can see windows server looks just like windows 10, but its not. You would not be able to get cognoes running on your desktop
23. Trust me i tried, it was humbling.
24. load up Microsoft edge explorer, and download Firefox.
25. Windows server will prompt you for every little url or download you click on, be sure to disable the advanced security feautures as it will get more and more tedious. 
26. Google 'disable windows server enhanced security' if you came this far you should be capable of configuring it
27. Log in to your IBM developer account
18. This took me days to find, but here is the old cognos version 10, in our IS470 course 
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/im/cognosbi/
19. Download the trial, list your adress or your real business as place of business. It's fine if you do not own a business you are now an Independent Contractor.
20. The instance will restart your server, just reconnect back or wait for it to reboot.
21. All the sample data is the same as the course data, so go ahead and have fun with it
